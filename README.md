# Desktop Virtual Assistant (Python)

A Python-based desktop virtual assistant that uses speech recognition and natural language processing to execute user commands such as opening applications, performing web searches, telling date/time, and basic system automation.

## Features
- Voice-based command input
- Speech-to-text using Python libraries
- Command interpretation using rule-based NLP
- Web search and browser automation
- System-level task execution (date, time, camera access)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- SpeechRecognition
- Pyttsx3
- Selenium (for browser automation)
- OS / system libraries

## How It Works
1. Captures voice input using microphone
2. Converts speech to text
3. Parses user intent using predefined NLP rules
4. Executes corresponding system or web-based command
5. Responds via text-to-speech

## Use Cases
- Hands-free system interaction
- Task automation
- Voice-based navigation
- Accessibility support

## Future Improvements
- ML-based intent classification
- Context-aware conversation
- Integration with APIs (email, calendar)
